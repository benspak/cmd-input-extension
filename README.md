Optimized Prompt for Chrome Browser Plugin Development:

Objective:
Develop a Chrome browser extension that automates text input using customizable keyboard shortcuts and commands.

Functional Requirements:

Command Recognition:

Users prepend a command with the prefix ;cmd (e.g., ;email) to trigger automated text pasting.

Keyboard Shortcut:

After typing a valid command followed by Ctrl + Enter, the saved text associated with the command will be pasted into the active input field, replacing the command itself.
Text Association and Management:

Allow users to save predefined text for each ;cmd command via a settings page or context menu within the plugin.

Support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for saved commands and their associated texts.
Overwriting Behavior:

Upon command execution (Ctrl + Enter press), replace the command entered in the field with the associated text.
Additional Considerations:

Provide error handling if an undefined command is used.
Include an intuitive settings interface for managing saved commands.
Ensure compatibility with common input fields across websites.
Follow best practices for Chrome extension development, keeping the extension lightweight and performant.
User Interaction Flow:

User enters ;cmd;example into a text field.
Upon pressing Ctrl + Enter:
If example is a saved command, replace the ;cmd;example text with its associated predefined value.
If example is undefined, show an error or fallback notification.
Extensions (Optional Features):

Add an option to toggle the functionality on/off.
Allow exporting and importing saved command configurations.
Provide usage analytics for popular commands (if relevant).
Outcome:
A streamlined extension that enables users to quickly input repetitive text snippets, enhancing productivity through custom commands and keyboard shortcuts.
